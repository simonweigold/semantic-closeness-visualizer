# Semantic Closeness Visualizer

The Semantic Closeness Visualizer (SCV) is a tool which lets the user input two strings of text with a maximum length of 150 characters. The SCV vectorizes these two strings of text and reduces the vectors to a dimensionality of two. The final grid is a 2d matrix of 16 by 64.

The SCV projects this 16 by 64 grid in a rectangle which has a layout of 1400 x 350. Each number of the vector is mapped to a single specific field within this rectangle and displayed in yellow for the first text.

The grid also includes a QR code as well as a legend for which text is portrayed by which color.
